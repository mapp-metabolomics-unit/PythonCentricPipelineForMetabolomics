The python centric pipeline for metabolomics (pcpfm) is a community-first tool and as such we welcome any and all suggestions and feature requests. 

If you would like to contribute this project, please do so by cloning this repository, creating a local branch, developing on said local branch, and then submitting the pull request. For examples on how to do this, take a look at numpy's guidelines: https://numpy.org/doc/stable/dev/index.html

Currently there are no strict coding style guidelines but please consider the following soft rules:

1. Pep8 coding conventions should be followed when possible.
2. Readability > performance, unless strictly necessary keep code less optimized but easier to follow
3. Consider edge cases and please add tests to your contributions. 
4. Pylint is not to be trusted blindly; however, please aim to have all *.py files have a rating > 9.0
5. The issues on github are to be used for bug reports, feature requests, or to ask general questions that may be usable to a wider community. If you have an issue that is highly specific to your use case, please email me directly at the below address.

If you have questions, please contact me at joshua.mitchell@jax.org.
